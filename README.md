### Project Requirements 
- We built on a previous project where we used SQL/PGAdmin to extract, transform, and load data for US and Russia YouTube Statistics. We added 8 more countries to our analysis. (something about database?)
- We chose to create a custom, creative visualization project using JavaScript and D3. 
- We used the (3d library) as a new JavaScript library
- Our final website include multiple forms of user driven interaction, such as a dropdown menu on the main page to navigate through and view the different data for each country. We also incorporated multiple interactive visualizations where the user can select what countries data to view, or which statistics to see.
- Our final project includes four unique visualizations, and one dashboard of different video metrics for each country.
