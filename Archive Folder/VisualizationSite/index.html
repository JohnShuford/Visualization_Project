						<h2>Observations</h2>
						<p>The US and Russia share the same most popular video of the year, the BTS music video for their song ‘Fake Love’.
							Many videos that were trending were popular in both countries (Youtube spotlight, Kylie Jenner, BTS, Logan Paul).
							US media is pretty popular in Russia, but most US videos are from US creators/content channels.
							The most viewed channels per category are not necessarily the most popular channels. When comparing the most popular categories as measured by views to the most popular channels measured by how many times they ended up on the trending list, you can see that these do not always line up. For example, in Russia, the comedy channel video with the most views is from Jimmy Fallon, but the comedy channel with the greatest amount of trending videos is Anatoly Shariy. This means that Jimmy Fallon had one incredibly popular video, but that Anatoly Shariy had many popular videos.
							The most disliked videos still have a lot of engagement, suggesting that views/comments might not be a valuable metric of likeability, and that ‘controversies’ can be very popular (for example, the most disliked and most commented on video in the US was an apology video from Logan Paul Vlogs).
							A trending video may receive a mass amount of views, but a large amount of views doesn’t necessarily mean a large amount of likes. For example, in the US, “Childish Gambino - This is America” received the most views at 225,211,923, but was liked only 2.2% of the time. The video with the highest percentage of likes per view was “Bruno Mars - Finesse”, receiving 29% of likes in a video viewed 548,621 times. In Russia, the most watched video “BTS - Fake Love” received 62,796,390 views with just 7.1% liking the video. However, the video with the highest percentage of likes per view was “Mora Saiyaan” with 94% of viewers liking the video.
							There are a few limitations to comparing the amount of views a video receives to the amount of likes and/or dislikes it receives. You do not need to have an account with YouTube to view videos, but you do need an account in order to like, dislike, or comment on a video. This limits the amount of viewers that could potentially interact with the video.</p>
